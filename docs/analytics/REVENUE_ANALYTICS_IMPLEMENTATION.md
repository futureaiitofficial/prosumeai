## Frontend Updates

### Admin Dashboard Component
**File:** `client/src/pages/admin/dashboard.tsx`

**Key Changes:**
1. **Replaced Mock Data:** Removed hardcoded mock data for revenue and user activity
2. **Real API Integration:** Added React Query hooks to fetch actual data
3. **Multi-Currency Charts:** Updated charts to display both USD and INR revenue
4. **Enhanced Visualizations:** 
   - Revenue charts now show separate bars for USD and INR
   - User activity charts show actual daily activity data
   - Added loading states for all charts
5. **New Revenue Summary Cards:** Display total revenue and MRR by currency
6. **Top Plans Display:** Show top performing subscription plans with revenue
7. **Activity Summary Cards:** Show period totals for various user activities

### New Components
- **Revenue Summary Cards:** Display key revenue metrics by currency
- **Activity Summary Cards:** Show user activity period totals
- **Top Plans List:** Ranked list of subscription plans by revenue

## Database Queries

### Revenue Analytics
The implementation queries the following tables:
- `payment_transactions` - For all payment data
- `user_subscriptions` - For subscription information
- `subscription_plans` - For plan details
- Joins these tables to correlate payments with plans and subscriptions

### User Activity Analytics
The implementation queries:
- `users` - For registration and login data
- `resumes` - For resume creation activity
- `cover_letters` - For cover letter creation activity  
- `user_subscriptions` - For subscription activity

## Key Features

### Multi-Currency Support
- Properly handles both INR (Indian Rupees) and USD (US Dollars)
- Separates revenue by currency for accurate reporting
- Calculates MRR correctly for different billing cycles

### Real-Time Data
- All charts and metrics now display actual database data
- Loading states provide better user experience
- Data automatically refreshes based on React Query settings

### Comprehensive Analytics
- Monthly recurring revenue calculation
- Currency-specific breakdowns
- Top performing plans identification
- Daily activity tracking across multiple metrics
- Active user counting

## Usage

### Revenue Tab
- View monthly revenue trends separated by currency
- See total revenue and transaction counts for each currency
- Monitor Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Identify top performing subscription plans

### Activity Tab
- Track daily user activity over time
- View period totals for registrations, content creation, and subscriptions
- Monitor active user counts
- Analyze user engagement patterns

### Overview Tab
- Quick summary of key metrics
- Revenue summary cards by currency
- Document distribution pie chart with real data

## Technical Implementation Notes

1. **SQL Queries:** Uses proper date formatting (`TO_CHAR`) and aggregation functions
2. **Currency Handling:** Properly handles decimal amounts and currency conversion
3. **Date Ranges:** Creates complete date ranges for consistent charting
4. **Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks and loading states
5. **Type Safety:** Proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Ensure you have payment transaction data in your database
2. Visit the admin dashboard at `/admin/dashboard`
3. Switch between the Overview, Activity, and Revenue tabs
4. Verify that charts display real data instead of mock data
5. Check that multi-currency revenue is properly separated and displayed

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:
1. **Date Range Selector:** Allow admins to select custom date ranges
2. **Export Functionality:** Export analytics data to CSV/Excel
3. **Forecast Modeling:** Predict future revenue based on trends
4. **Cohort Analysis:** Track user retention and lifecycle value
5. **Regional Analytics:** Break down revenue and activity by geographic region
6. **Plan Performance:** Detailed analysis of individual subscription plan performance
