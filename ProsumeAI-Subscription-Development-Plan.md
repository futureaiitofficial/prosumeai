# ProsumeAI Subscription System Development Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation strategy for ProsumeAI's subscription-based pricing model.

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks

1. **Payment gateway integration issues**
   - Mitigation: Start with sandbox/test environments early
   - Contingency: Prepare manual subscription management as fallback

2. **Subscription sync failures**
   - Mitigation: Implement robust error handling and retry logic
   - Contingency: Create admin tools for manual synchronization

3. **Feature access bypass attempts**
   - Mitigation: Implement comprehensive anti-abuse systems
   - Contingency: Regular audits and monitoring

4. **User experience issues with limitations**
   - Mitigation: Clear communication about limits and upgrade paths
   - Contingency: Adjustable limits based on user feedback

## Resources Required

### Development Team
- 2 Backend developers
- 2 Frontend developers
- 1 DevOps engineer
- 1 QA specialist

### External Services
- Razorpay account (production and sandbox)
- PayPal Business account
- Analytics tools

- Average revenue per user
- Churn rate
- Feature usage distribution
- Support tickets related to subscription issues

## Post-Launch Evaluation

Conduct a comprehensive review 4 weeks after launch to evaluate:
