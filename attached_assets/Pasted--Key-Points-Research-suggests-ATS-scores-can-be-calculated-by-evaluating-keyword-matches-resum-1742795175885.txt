### Key Points
- Research suggests ATS scores can be calculated by evaluating keyword matches, resume formatting, and relevance to job descriptions, but exact methods vary by system.
- It seems likely that a general ATS score can assess standard practices like section headers and date formats, while a job-specific score compares resumes to a given job description.
- The evidence leans toward using both general and job-specific scores for comprehensive feedback, with weights assigned to factors like keyword presence and structure.

### Direct Answer

#### Overview
Calculating an ATS (Applicant Tracking System) score for resumes helps users optimize their documents for automated screening by employers. This score reflects how well a resume matches job requirements and follows ATS-friendly practices. You can implement both a general ATS score, based on standard best practices, and a job-specific score, tailored to a particular job description, to give users comprehensive feedback.

#### General ATS Score
The general ATS score evaluates how well your resume follows universal best practices. Here's how to calculate it:
- **Check Section Headers**: Ensure standard sections like "Experience," "Education," and "Skills" are present (20% weight).
- **Verify Date Formatting**: Confirm dates in experience and education are correctly formatted (15% weight).
- **Include Keywords**: Look for general desirable keywords like "teamwork" or "communication" (20% weight).
- **Use Action Verbs**: Check for action verbs like "managed" or "developed" in the experience section (10% weight).
- **Assess Length**: Ensure the resume is within a desirable range, e.g., 400-800 words (10% weight).
- **Confirm Contact Info**: Verify name, email, and phone number are included (15% weight).

Score each factor as a percentage (0-100%), then multiply by its weight and sum for the total score. For example, if all factors score 100%, the total is 100%.

#### Job-Specific ATS Score
For a job-specific score, users input a job description. Here's the process:
- Extract keywords from the job description by removing stop words and identifying important terms.
- Compare these keywords with the resume, counting matches.
- Calculate the score as (number of matching keywords / total unique keywords in job description) * 100%.

This score shows how well the resume aligns with a specific job, helping users tailor their content.

#### Unexpected Detail
An unexpected detail is that some ATS systems may also consider semantic similarity, using advanced NLP techniques like word embeddings, to assess relevance beyond simple keyword matches, though this is more complex to implement.

### Comprehensive Guidance on Calculating ATS Scores for Resume Builder

This section provides a detailed exploration of how to calculate ATS (Applicant Tracking System) scores for resumes within your resume builder tool, ensuring users can optimize their documents for automated screening by employers. The approach includes both general and job-specific scoring mechanisms, drawing from industry best practices and research into ATS functionality.

#### Understanding ATS Scores
ATS systems are software tools used by companies, particularly large organizations like Fortune 500 companies, to manage and filter job applications efficiently. Research indicates that over 98% of Fortune 500 companies use ATS programs, with 75% of candidates being "phased out" if they don't pass initial screenings ([Jobscan ATS Overview](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems)). These systems score resumes based on how well they align with job requirements, often using AI and natural language processing to parse and rank applications. The "ATS score" is typically a measure of this alignment, though exact algorithms vary by system and are proprietary.

Given this variability, your resume builder can implement a dual scoring system: a general ATS score based on universal best practices and a job-specific score tailored to a provided job description. This approach ensures users receive comprehensive feedback, enhancing their chances of passing ATS filters and reaching human reviewers.

#### General ATS Score: Methodology and Factors
The general ATS score evaluates how well a resume adheres to standard practices that most ATS systems can parse effectively. This score is particularly useful when users are building their resume without a specific job in mind, providing a baseline for optimization. Below is a detailed breakdown of factors, their weights, and how to calculate scores for each:

- **Section Headers (20%)**: ATS systems rely on recognizable section headers to parse information. Standard headers include "Experience," "Work History," "Professional Experience," "Education," "Academic Background," "Skills," and "Certifications." To score:
  - Define a list of expected headers (e.g., 4-6 common ones).
  - Check the resume for these headers using text matching.
  - Score as (number of matching headers / total expected headers) * 100%.
  - Example: If 4 headers are expected and 3 are present, score is 75%.

- **Date Formatting (15%)**: Correct date formatting is crucial for ATS to extract timelines. Look for patterns like "MM/YYYY," "YYYY-MM," or "Month Year" in experience and education sections. To score:
  - Identify all date-like patterns in the resume.
  - Verify they follow standard formats (e.g., no missing years, consistent style).
  - Score as 100% if all dates are correctly formatted, reduce proportionally for errors.
  - Example: If 5 dates are present and 4 are correct, score is 80%.

- **Keyword Inclusion (20%)**: General desirable keywords, often soft skills, are commonly looked for across resumes. Examples include "teamwork," "communication," "leadership," "problem-solving," "analytical thinking," "time management," "adaptability," "customer service," and "project management." To score:
  - Maintain a predefined list of 10-15 general keywords.
  - Count how many appear in the resume (case-insensitive, whole words).
  - Score as (number of matching keywords / total keywords) * 100%.
  - Example: If 10 keywords are defined and 6 are present, score is 60%.

- **Action Verbs (10%)**: Action verbs in the experience section, such as "managed," "led," "developed," "implemented," "coordinated," "supervised," "trained," "designed," "created," and "improved," signal achievement and are favored by ATS. To score:
  - Identify the experience section using headers.
  - Count unique action verbs used in bullet points or descriptions.
  - Score as 100% if at least one action verb per experience entry, reduce if missing.
  - Example: If 3 experience entries and 2 have action verbs, score is ~67%.

- **Length (10%)**: ATS systems may penalize resumes that are too long or too short, with a desirable range typically 400-800 words. To score:
  - Count the total word count of the resume.
  - Score as 100% if within 400-800 words, taper off linearly outside this range (e.g., 300 words = 75%, 900 words = 75%).
  - Example: 600 words = 100%, 300 words = 75%.

- **Contact Information (15%)**: ATS needs clear contact details to forward applications. Check for name, email, and phone number. To score:
  - Look for patterns matching email formats (e.g., user@domain.com) and phone numbers (e.g., (123) 456-7890).
  - Score as 100% if all three are present, reduce for missing items (e.g., 67% if only name and email).
  - Example: All present = 100%, missing phone = 67%.

To calculate the overall general ATS score, multiply each factor's score by its weight and sum:
- Total Score = (Section Headers * 0.2) + (Date Formatting * 0.15) + (Keyword Inclusion * 0.2) + (Action Verbs * 0.1) + (Length * 0.1) + (Contact Information * 0.15)

Example Calculation:
- Section Headers: 75% → 75 * 0.2 = 15
- Date Formatting: 80% → 80 * 0.15 = 12
- Keyword Inclusion: 60% → 60 * 0.2 = 12
- Action Verbs: 67% → 67 * 0.1 = 6.7
- Length: 100% → 100 * 0.1 = 10
- Contact Information: 100% → 100 * 0.15 = 15
- Total = 15 + 12 + 12 + 6.7 + 10 + 15 = 70.7%

This score (e.g., 70.7%) gives users a baseline, with feedback on areas to improve, such as adding missing headers or keywords.

#### Job-Specific ATS Score: Methodology and Factors
The job-specific ATS score is calculated when users provide a job description, allowing for tailored optimization. This score reflects how well the resume matches the specific job's requirements, crucial for passing ATS filters for targeted applications. Here's the process:

- **Extract Keywords from Job Description**: Tokenize the job description into words, remove common stop words (e.g., "the," "and," "is"), and identify important keywords. For simplicity, use frequency to weight importance (words appearing multiple times are more critical). For advanced implementation, consider using NLP libraries like spaCy to extract key phrases or entities.

- **Match Keywords with Resume**: Tokenize the resume, remove stop words, and count how many job description keywords appear in the resume. For a basic approach, count exact matches (case-insensitive, whole words). For better accuracy, consider semantic similarity using word embeddings or cosine similarity, though this requires more computational resources.

- **Calculate Score**: Compute the score as (number of matching keywords / total unique keywords in job description) * 100%. To account for keyword importance, weight matches by their frequency in the job description:
  - Let \( K \) be the set of unique keywords in the job description, with frequency \( f(k) \) for each keyword \( k \).
  - Let \( M \) be the set of matching keywords in the resume.
  - Score = (Σ \( f(k) \) for \( k \in M \) / Σ \( f(k) \) for all \( k \in K \)) * 100%.

Example:
- Job Description Keywords: "teamwork" (2 times), "communication" (3 times), "leadership" (1 time), total frequency sum = 6.
- Resume matches: "teamwork," "communication" → Matching frequency sum = 2 + 3 = 5.
- Score = (5 / 6) * 100% = 83.3%.

This score provides users with specific feedback, highlighting missing keywords to include for better alignment with the job.

#### Implementation Considerations
- **General ATS Score**: Use simple text processing techniques to check headers, dates, and keywords. Provide feedback like "Add 'Skills' section for better ATS compatibility" or "Include more action verbs like 'managed' in experience."
- **Job-Specific ATS Score**: Allow users to input or select a job description (e.g., via a text field or integration with job boards). Offer suggestions like "Add 'communication' to match job description keywords."
- **Scalability**: For large user bases, consider using cloud-based NLP APIs (e.g., Google Cloud Document AI, AWS Comprehend) for advanced parsing, though this may incur costs beyond free tiers.

#### Unexpected Detail: Semantic Similarity
An unexpected detail is that some ATS systems may use advanced NLP techniques, like word embeddings or cosine similarity, to assess semantic similarity beyond simple keyword matches. This means resumes with synonymous terms (e.g., "team player" instead of "teamwork") might still score well, though implementing this in your builder would require significant computational resources and data, making it more suitable for enterprise-level tools.

| Contact Information    | 15         | 100% if name, email, phone present, reduce for missing items                  |

This table summarizes the general ATS score factors and their calculation methods, aiding in implementation.

#### Conclusion
By implementing both general and job-specific ATS scores, your resume builder can provide users with actionable insights to optimize their resumes, increasing their chances of passing ATS filters and securing interviews. The general score offers a baseline for structure, while the job-specific score tailors feedback to specific roles, ensuring comprehensive support for users building their resumes.
